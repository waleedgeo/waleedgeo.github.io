# Mirza Waleed 🙂

**PhD student (Geography) at the [Department of Geography](https://geog.hkbu.edu.hk/), [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/), Hong Kong (SAR).**

My research interest includes: Geographic Information Science (GIS), Remote Sensing, and Environmental Modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying geospatial techniques, machine learning, and cloud computing (e.g., [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)) in Hazards-Risk assessment, Environmental Change Monitoring, Floods Mapping & Automation, Land-use science, UTFVI (Urban Heat Island effect), and climate change.

Besides, I'm a (5 star rated & Level-1) freelancer at [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/waleed_gis) and provides Google Earth Engine based consultancy services. I have ~4 years of experience in geospatial domain, and have worked on more then 100 projects on remote sensing, GEE, and Geospatial science.

My current focus is towards regional to global scale studies addressing flood risk assessment using earth observation data/techniques. For this I am working as well as open to any collaboration opportunity.
