I am currently enrolled in a fully funded PhD position at [HKBU, HK](https://geog.hkbu.edu.hk/postgraduate/research_students/). I completed my bachelor in Environmental Sciences from COMSATS University Islamabad with Remote Sensing and GIS as my major and received an A+ grade in my [final year research project and thesis](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17454-y).

I have been working in the Remote Sensing domain for the last five years focusing on Google Earth Engine, Geospatial Data Science, and Machine/Deep Learning. My research interests include but are not limited to:
- Application of Remote Sensing in Disaster Management and Risk Assessment.

- Flood Risk Assessment, Mapping, Susceptibility, and Damage Assessment.

- Historical Monitoring and Future Forecasting of land use and land cover (LULC) and Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect patterns for Sustainabile urban planning

- Applications of Google Earth Engine

```
Note:
My current research focus is towards regional to global scale studies addressing flood risk assessment using earth observation data/techniques. Additionally I am also interested in the applications of Google Earth Engine for Disaster Managemetn. For this I am working as well as open to any collaboration opportunity.
